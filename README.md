# gpt-repository-loader

`gpt-repository-loader` is a command-line tool that converts the contents of a Git repository into a text format, preserving the structure of the files and file contents. The generated output can be interpreted by AI language models, allowing them to process the repository's contents for various tasks, such as code review or documentation generation.

## Getting Started

To get started with `gpt-repository-loader`, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the `gpt-repository-loader` repository.
3. Navigate to the repository's root directory in your terminal.
4. Run `gpt-repository-loader` with the following command:

   ```bash
   python gpt_repository_loader.py /path/to/git/repository
   ```
    Replace `/path/to/git/repository` with the path to the Git repository you want to process.

5. The tool will generate an output.txt file containing the text representation of the repository. You can now use this file as input for AI language models or other text-based processing tasks.
